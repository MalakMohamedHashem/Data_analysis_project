# Employee Data Analysis Project

This project was done in collaboration with DEPI as part of a data analysis initiative. The core idea revolves around analyzing employee-related data to provide insights that can help Human Resources (HR) teams improve decision-making, enhance employee performance, and ultimately contribute to the success of the company.

## 📁 Project Structure

The original data was provided in multiple separate files, all located in the `orgn.files` folder. Each file contained different types of information related to employees (e.g., demographics, performance, attendance, etc.).

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Each file underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing process that involved:

- Handling missing values (nulls)
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardizing formats
- Ensuring data consistency

After processing each file individually, we extracted the most relevant **features** and merged them into a single, comprehensive dataset named:  
📄 `final data`

## 📊 Data Usage

The final dataset was used to:

- Build interactive dashboards using **Tableau**  
- Perform various analytical tasks to extract meaningful insights

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of the project is to assist HR departments in:

- Understanding employee behavior and performance
- Identifying areas of improvement
- Making data-driven decisions to boost productivity
- Supporting strategic planning for company growth

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (for data cleaning, merging, and preprocessing)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Tableau** (for data visualization and dashboarding)

## 📌 Example Use Cases

- Detect departments with high turnover rates
- Visualize attendance patterns
- Analyze performance trends across different teams
- Identify potential training or development needs

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install required packages (example):
3. Open `analysis.ipynb` and run the notebook.
